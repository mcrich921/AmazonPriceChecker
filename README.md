**My inspiration:**<br>
One of the hardest parts about being into fitness as a college student is getting enough protein in daily in an affordable way. Oftentimes I am on the go and do not have the kitchen (or even time) to make high protein meals, so I have to resort to protein bars and other snack variants. The one problem with that... they're incredibly expensive. So I am working on making a python script that will email me when there's a price drop so I can stock up during deals.
